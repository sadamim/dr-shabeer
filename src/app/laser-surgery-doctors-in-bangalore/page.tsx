                        <p className="text-justify">
                            Laser surgery is an increasingly popular treatment option for various anorectal conditions due to its precision, technical advancement, minimal invasiveness, and reduced recovery time.
                            It involves the use of laser energy to remove or treat tissues in the anal and rectal area.
                            Below are the common anorectal conditions treated with laser surgery along with their benefits and general approach.

                        {/* Hemorrhoids */}
                        <h6>1. Hemorrhoids: Laser Hemorrhoidoplasty (LHP)</h6>
                        <p className="text-justify">
                            This procedure is used for the treatment of internal hemorrhoids. A laser fiber is introduced into the hemorrhoidal pile, and laser energy is delivered, causing the hemorrhoid to shrink.
                            It cuts off blood flow to the hemorrhoidal vessels, leading to reduced swelling and fibrosis over time.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Strong Family History:</strong> Genetics can strongly influence how body stores fat and how it burns calories.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gene Variations:</strong> Specific genes like those affecting leptin may be altered in some individuals, leading to increased hunger or impaired metabolism.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p className="text-justify"><strong>Benefits:</strong> Minimal bleeding, less post-operative pain, quicker recovery compared to conventional hemorrhoidectomy.</p>

                        {/* Anal Fissures */}
                        <h6>2. Anal Fissures</h6>
                        <p className="text-justify">
                            Chronic anal fissures can be treated with LASER LIS by carefully removing the fissure tissue and promoting healing.
                            The laser helps reduce muscle spasms in the anal sphincter and promotes blood flow to the area.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Less pain, quicker healing, and reduced risk of infection.</li>

                        <p className="text-justify">
                            Many types of laser procedures like LAFT, FILAC, DLPS, Fixicision, VAAFT are used to ablate the fistula tract from within.
                            These techniques promote healing without extensive cutting of tissues.
                        </p>

                        <p className="text-justify">
                            Laser surgery can be used to treat pilonidal sinus disease by ablating the sinus tract and promoting closure.
                            It is particularly beneficial for recurrent cases where traditional surgery has failed.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Faster healing, less pain, and a lower risk of recurrence.</li>
