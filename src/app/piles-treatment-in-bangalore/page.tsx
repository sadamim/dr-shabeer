                        <p className="text-justify">
                            Piles, also known as hemorrhoids, are swollen and inflamed blood vessels in the rectum or anus.
                            They can cause discomfort, pain, and sometimes bleeding, especially during bowel movements.
                            Piles are classified into two main types — internal and external — and may require lifestyle changes, medical treatments, or surgical intervention depending on severity.

                        <h4>Types of Hemorrhoids</h4>

                        <h6>1. Internal Hemorrhoids</h6>
                        <p className="text-justify">
                            These develop inside the rectum and are usually painless but can cause bleeding.
                            In more severe cases, they may protrude from the anus — called prolapsed hemorrhoids.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Grade I:</strong> Small swellings inside the lining of the rectum; not visible externally.</li>
                            <li><strong>Grade II:</strong> Larger swellings that may come out during bowel movement but go back in by themselves.</li>
                            <li><strong>Grade III:</strong> Swellings that protrude and need to be pushed back manually.</li>
                            <li><strong>Grade IV:</strong> Protruded hemorrhoids that cannot be pushed back and may require urgent medical attention.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6>2. External Hemorrhoids</h6>
                        <p className="text-justify">
                            These form under the skin around the anus and can be painful, especially if a blood clot forms (thrombosed hemorrhoid).
                        </p>

                        {/* Common Symptoms */}

                            <li>Bright red blood after a bowel movement (painless bleeding is common in internal hemorrhoids)</li>
                            <li>Itching or irritation around the anus</li>
                            <li>Swelling or a lump near the anus</li>

                        <h6>1. Lifestyle Changes</h6>
                        <p className="text-justify">
                            For mild cases, lifestyle modifications often provide relief:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Increase fiber intake with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink plenty of water to soften stools and reduce straining.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Regular physical activity helps improve digestion and prevent constipation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6>2. Topical Treatments</h6>
                        <p className="text-justify">
                            Creams, ointments, and suppositories can help relieve discomfort and reduce inflammation.
                            These are typically used in early stages or for symptomatic relief.
                        </p>

                        <h6>3. Minimally Invasive Procedures</h6>
                        <p className="text-justify">
                            For more persistent or severe cases, non-surgical treatments include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Rubber Band Ligation:</strong> A rubber band is placed at the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off its blood supply.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sclerotherapy:</strong> Injection of a solution that shrinks the hemorrhoid.</li>
                            <li><strong>Infrared Coagulation:</strong> Heat is used to destroy the hemorrhoidal tissue.</li>
                            <li><strong>Laser Hemorrhoidoplasty (LHP):</strong> Laser energy is used to shrink internal hemorrhoids with minimal pain and faster recovery.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6>4. Surgical Treatment</h6>
                        <p className="text-justify">
                            Surgery may be required when conservative treatments fail or in advanced cases:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hemorrhoidectomy:</strong> Complete surgical removal of hemorrhoids (used for large or severe cases).</li>
                            <li><strong>Hemorrhoidopexy:</strong> Stapling procedure that repositions the hemorrhoids and reduces blood flow to them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Laser Surgery:</strong> A modern, minimally invasive option with reduced bleeding, less pain, and quicker recovery.</li>

                            <li><strong>Minimally Invasive:</strong> No cuts or stitches required in most cases.</li>
                            <li><strong>Less Bleeding:</strong> Laser seals blood vessels as it treats the hemorrhoids.</li>
                            <li><strong>Faster Recovery:</strong> Most patients resume normal activities within a few days.</li>
                            <li><strong>Outpatient Procedure:</strong> Usually performed on a daycare basis without hospitalization.</li>
