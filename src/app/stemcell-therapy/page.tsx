                        <p className="text-justify">
                            Stem cell therapy is an advanced medical treatment that utilizes the body’s own regenerative potential to repair damaged tissues, organs, and cells.
                            Stem cells have the unique ability to differentiate into specialized cells, enabling them to treat a variety of diseases.
                            At Dr Shabeer Ahmed Clinic, we use ethically sourced stem cells to provide personalized treatment plans designed to improve outcomes for our patients.
